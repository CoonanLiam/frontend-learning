# Frontend Learning Journey

This repository documents my learning progress in frontend development
as part of my apprenticeship as a Software Developer (Fachinformatiker für Anwendungsentwicklung).

## Purpose
The goal of this repository is not to showcase perfect code,
but to build a solid understanding of frontend fundamentals
and how user interfaces interact with underlying systems.

## Topics Covered
- HTML fundamentals
- CSS basics & layout
- Typescript basics
- Small UI experiments and mini-projects

## Learning Approach
- Structured, step-by-step learning
- Focus on clarity and maintainability
- Continuous improvement and documentation

## Long-Term Goal
Build a strong technical foundation to better collaborate with engineers
and move towards system-oriented roles such as Technical Operations
or Program Management in the future.
